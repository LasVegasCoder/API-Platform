  AT&T API Platform Samples - Notary app 1
 ------------------------------

This application allows the user to sign a payload for sending in a New Transaction
or New Subscription request to the Payment API. The Single Pay application and the
Subscription application both use the Notary application to sign the payload in the
background before making a New Transaction or New Subscription request, and both
applications provide a link to the Notary app to view the most recent payload sent
and the received signed payload and signature.

This file describes how to set up, configure and run the C# Applications of the 
AT&T API Platform sample applications. It covers all steps required to register the
application on DevConnect and, based on the generated API keys and secrets,
create and run one's own full-fledged sample applications.

  1. Configuration
  2. Installation
  3. Parameters
  4. Running the application


1. Configuration

  Configuration consists of a few steps necessary to get an application registered
  on DevConnect with the proper services and endpoints, depending on the type of
  client-side application (autonomous/non-autonomous). 

  To register an application, go to https://devconnect-api.att.com/ and login with
  your valid username and password. Next, choose "My Apps" from the bar at the top
  of the page and click the "Setup a New Application" button. 

  Fill in the form, in particular all fields marked as "required".

  Be careful while filling in the "OAuth Redirect URL" field. It should contain the
  URL that the oAuth provider will redirect users to when he/she successfully
  authenticates and authorizes your application.

NOTE: You MUST select Payment in the list of services under field 'Services' in
order to use this sample application code. 

  Having your application registered, you will get back an important pair of data:
  an API key and Secret key. They are necessary to get your applications working
  with the AT&T Platform APIs.

  Initially your newly registered application is restricted to the "Sandbox"
  environment only. To move it to production, you may promote it by clicking the
  "Promote to production" button. Notice that you will get a different API key and secret,
  so these values in your application should be adjusted accordingly.

  Depending on the kind of authentication used, an application may be based on 
  either the Autonomous Client or the Web-Server Client OAuth flow (see 
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/autonomous-client-application-oauth-flow or
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/web-server-client-application-oauth-flow
  respectively).



2. Installation

** Requirements

   To run the examples you need an IIS Server. 

   Download the application files from the download link published in AT&T portal
   into webdomain of your IIS server.



3. Parameters

Each sample application contains a web.config file. It holds configurable parameters
described in an easy to read format. Please populate the following parameters in
web.config file as specified below:

1) api_key                		: This is mandatory parameter, Set the value
					  as per your registered appliaction 'API key'
					  field value.

2) secret_key     	  		: This is mandatory parameter, Set the value
					  as per your registered appliaction 'Secret key'
					  field value.

3) FQDN		  			: This is mandatory parameter, Set it to the
					  end point URI of AT&T Service.

4) paymentType				: subscription (This is mandatory parameter,
					  to specify Single Pay application or
					  Subscription application. Valid values are
					  "subscription" or "transaction".)

5) scope				: PAYMENT (Scope of the ATT service that will
					  be invoked by the Application)

6) Amount				: 1.90 (This is mandatory parameter, to specify
					  the transaction value and has to be in decimal
					  format.)

7) Category				: 1 (Category of the product)

8) Channel				: MOBILE_WEB

9) MerchantPaymentRedirectUrl		: Set to the URL pointing to the application.
					  ATT platform uses this URL to return the
					  control back to the application after 
					  transaction is completed. Example : 
					  https://IIS_HOSTNAME:8080/payment/app1/Default.aspx

10) IsPurchaseOnNoActiveSubscription	: false ("false" if its a new subscription)

11) SubscriptionRecurringNumber		: 9999

12) SubscriptionRecurringPeriod		: MONTHLY

13) SubscriptionRecurringPeriodAmount	: 1 (This is optional parameter and its
					  default value is 1.)


Note: If your application is promoted from Sandbox environment to Production
environment and you decide to use production application settings, you must update
parameters 1-2 as per production application details.



4. Running the application

Suppose you copied the sample app files in your IIS server webroot/notary/app1/ folder.
In order to run the sample application, type in'http://IIS_HOSTNAME/notary/app1/Default.aspx'.
