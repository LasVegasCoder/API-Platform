  AT&T API Platform Samples - Payment app 2
 ---------------------------------
This application allows the user to 

  1. Make a new subscription to product 1 or product 2
  2. View the details of the notary signPayload request made in the background
  3. Get status of the subscription
  4. Get details of subscriptions
  4. Refund any of the latest five subscriptions
  5. View the latest five notifications.

To make a new subscription request, the app uses the Notary app in the background
to sign the payload first.

This file describes how to set up, configure and run the VB Applications of the
AT&T API Platform sample applications. It covers all steps required to register
the application on DevConnect and, based on the generated API keys and secrets, 
create and run one's own full-fledged sample applications.

  1. Configuration
  2. Installation
  3. Parameters
  4. Running the application


1. Configuration

  Configuration consists of a few steps necessary to get an application registered
  on DevConnect with the proper services and endpoints, depending on the type of
  client-side application (autonomous/non-autonomous). 

  To register an application, go to https://devconnect-api.att.com/ and login with
  your valid username and password. Next, choose "My Apps" from the bar at the top
  of the page and click the "Setup a New Application" button. 

  Fill in the form, in particular all fields marked as "required".

  Be careful while filling in the "OAuth Redirect URL" field. It should contain the
  URL that the oAuth provider will redirect users to when he/she successfully
  authenticates and authorizes your application.

NOTE: You MUST select Payment in the list of services under field 'Services' in order
to use this sample application code. 

  Having your application registered, you will get back an important pair of data:
  an API key and Secret key. They are necessary to get your applications working
  with the AT&T Platform APIs. 

  Initially your newly registered application is restricted to the "Sandbox"
  environment only. To move it to production, you may promote it by clicking the
  "Promote to production" button. Notice that you will get a different API key and
  secret, so these values in your application should be adjusted accordingly.

  Depending on the kind of authentication used, an application may be based on either
  the Autonomous Client or the Web-Server Client OAuth flow (see 
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/autonomous-client-application-oauth-flow or
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/web-server-client-application-oauth-flow
  respectively).
