  AT&T API Platform Samples - Payment app 1
 ---------------------------------
This application allows the user to 

  1. Make a new transaction to buy product 1 or product 2
  2. View the details of the notary signPayload request made in the background
  3. Get the transaction status of that transaction
  4. Refund any of the latest five transactions
  5. View the latest five notifications. 

To make a new transaction request, the app uses the Notary app in the background
to sign the payload first.

This file describes how to set up, configure and run the C# Applications of the
AT&T API Platform sample applications. It covers all steps required to register
the application on DevConnect and, based on the generated API keys and secrets, 
create and run one's own full-fledged sample applications.

  1. Configuration
  2. Installation
  3. Parameters
  4. Running the application


1. Configuration

  Configuration consists of a few steps necessary to get an application registered
  on DevConnect with the proper services and endpoints, depending on the type of
  client-side application (autonomous/non-autonomous). 

  To register an application, go to https://devconnect-api.att.com/ and login with
  your valid username and password. Next, choose "My Apps" from the bar at the top
  of the page and click the "Setup a New Application" button. 

  Fill in the form, in particular all fields marked as "required".

  Be careful while filling in the "OAuth Redirect URL" field. It should contain the
  URL that the oAuth provider will redirect users to when he/she successfully
  authenticates and authorizes your application.

NOTE: You MUST select Payment in the list of services under field 'Services' in
order to use this sample application code. 

  Having your application registered, you will get back an important pair of data:
  an API key and Secret key. They are necessary to get your applications working
  with the AT&T platform APIs. 

  Initially your newly registered application is restricted to the "Sandbox"
  environment only. To move it to production, you may promote it by clicking the
  "Promote to production" button. Notice that you will get a different API key and
  secret, so these values in your application should be adjusted accordingly.

  Depending on the kind of authentication used, an application may be based on
  either the Autonomous Client or the Web-Server Client OAuth flow (see 
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/autonomous-client-application-oauth-flow or
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/web-server-client-application-oauth-flow
  respectively).



2. Installation

** Requirements

   To run the examples you need an IIS Server. 

   Download the application files from the download link published in AT&T portal
   into webdomain of your IIS server.



3. Parameters

Each sample application contains a web.config file. It holds configurable parameters
described in an easy to read format. Please populate the following parameters in
web.config file as specified below:

1) api_key                	: This is mandatory parameter, Set the value as per
				  your registered appliaction 'API key' field value.

2) secret_key     	  	: This is mandatory parameter,Set the value as per
				  your registered appliaction 'Secret key' field value.

3) endPoint		  	: This is mandatory parameter, Set it to the end point
				  URI of AT&T Service.

4) AccessTokenFilePath		: ~\\PayApp1AccessToken.txt (This is optional parameter,
				  which points to the file path, where application
				  stores access token information. If the parameter is
				  not configured, it will take the default value as 
				  ~\\PayApp1AccessToken.txt. Give read/write access to
				  this file.)

5) scope			: PAYMENT (Scope of the ATT service that will be
				  invoked by the Application)

6) Category                     : 1 (Category of the product)

7) Channel                      : MOBILE_WEB

8) MerchantPaymentRedirectUrl	: Set to the URL pointing to the application. ATT
				  platform uses this URL to return the control back
				  to the application after transaction is completed.
				  Example: https://IIS_HOSTNAME:8080/payment/app1/Default.aspx

9) notaryURL                    : Set to the URL pointing to Notary application.
				  Payment application uses Notary application to get
				  the SignedDocument and Signature to be used in
				  New Transaction.
				  Example: https://IIS_HOSTNAME:8080/notary/app1/Default.aspx

10) notificationDetailsFile     : ~\\notificationDetailsFile.txt: (This is optional
				  parameter, which points to the file path, where the
				  notification details will be saved by listener. If
				  the parameter is not configured, it will take the
				  default value as ~\\notificationDetailsFile.txt.
				  Give read/write access to this file.)

11) refundFile	                : ~\\refundFile.txt: (This is optional parameter,
				  which points to the file path, where latest
				  transaction IDs will be stored. If the parameter is
				  not configured, it will take the default value as 
				  ~\\refundFile.txt. Give read/write access to this file.)

12) refundCountToDisplay	: This is optional key, which will allow to display
				  the defined number of transactions for refund table,
				  default is 5.


Note: You must update parameters 1-2 after you promote your application from 'Sandbox'
environment to 'Production' environment.



4. Running the application

Suppose you copied the sample app files in your IIS server webroot/payment/app1/ folder.
In order to run the sample application, type in
'http://IIS_HOSTNAME:8080/payment/app1/Default.aspx'(assuming you're using a HOSTNAME
machine with IIS Server and have not changed the default port number, otherwise adjust
accordingly) on your web browser.
